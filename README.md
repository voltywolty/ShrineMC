# ShrineMC

### About ShrineMC
This ShrineMC plugin is the main plugin for my Minecraft server that hosts Dwarves vs Zombies. I publicized this repository in order to help those who want to have their own master server plugin, while being able to learn and modify it at the same time. This plugin is very barebone right now, but I plan to add more features in the upcoming months and possibly years.

### Usage for the ShrineMC Plugin
You are allowed to use this plugin however you want, but if you use the plugin itself without modifying anything, please provide some credit. You are free to use this in any server. If you are interested in modifying this, fork the project, and edit the code however you like.
